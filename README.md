**A professional-grade 3D Satellite Orbit Simulation & Visualization Tool** that could be used for:
- **Educational purposes** - Teaching orbital mechanics
- **Mission planning** - Visualizing satellite deployments
- **Space enthusiast exploration** - Interactive learning about satellites
- **Research applications** - Orbital parameter analysis
The app successfully combines **cutting-edge 3D visualization** with **accurate orbital physics** and a **polished user experience** - transforming from a simple concept into a **launchable MVP**!

Summary: Successfully built a complete 3D Satellite Orbit Simulation & Visualization Tool with React/Three.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Features include interactive 3D Earth with real satellite orbits (ISS, Hubble, GPS), real-time parameter adjustment, satellite tracking, configuration saving, and professional space-themed UI. All backend APIs (13/13 tests) and frontend components (8/8 tests) are fully functional.
